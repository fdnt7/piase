🍎 My `osu!catch` skin.

## Usage

To use this skin, zip the `src` directory up into a file, then change its extension to `.osk`. Finally, simply open the file with `osu!`, and it will automatically be imported.

## Attributions

All hitsounds have been taken from [BlooMoon Re;Done v1.0](https://skins.osuck.net/skins/2530). All sprites were made by me.
